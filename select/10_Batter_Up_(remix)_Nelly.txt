Welcome ladies and gentlemen
This is Mark, oh, who gives a fuck from '93 TV?
This is my co-host, Bob Buttafuoco, Bob say, hi
Hey hey guys, yeah yeah yeah

We got a crowd that's in a frenzy Bob
Let's go down to the announcers for the start of the game
And now, please rise for the singin' of our national anthem

I say the fish don't fry in the kitchen
Beans don't burn on the grill
It took a whole lot of tah-ryin'
Just to get up that hill

I said but now we're up in the Big Leagues
My dirty, it's our turn at bat
And just as long as we livin', it's Lunatics playa
It ain't nuttin' wrong with that, huh, batter up

I'm the first to swing
Home run with that give me what you got thing
Hot wings, fuck a duck, smoke an ounce, show me love
Hit the club, me and T-Luv holla what

I put my mack down, she threw a curve ball
She owed Milli smoked that herb and some Llly-bone
She tip-top 'em, Optimo
First base, God livin' like a worst race

First chase, throw yo' people and yo' kind
Second lesson, smoke that herb and clear yo' mind
It's about time, second base wisdom rhyme
Hittin' strong, skipped third base and headed home

Third baseman just don't understand baby, what the bomb
What the fuck wrong with this world today
With these girls today, diamonds and pearls the way
You wasn't fuckin' with me, leave, for the wrap that's in my seed

Now you stays on yo knees
'Cause we's be in the Big League
'Cause we's be in the Big Leauge

I say the fish don't fry in the kitchen
Beans don't burn on the grill
It took a whole lot of tah-ryin'
Just to get up that hill

I said but now we're up in the Big Leagues
My dirty, it's our turn at bat
And just as long as we livin', it's Lunatics playa
It ain't nuttin' wrong with that, huh, batter up

Well you should see me now, I'm eatin' Wheaties now
I'm stealin' second and third and lookin' home gettin' greedy now
See me now, people call me Speedy now
Known for runnin' the quickest miles, hit and run in any town, any ground

Rules 'fore I hit it, split it, lick it and quit it
And hit it, lick it, did I say lick it, fuck it, lick it
Ain't no shame in my game, that normal shit ain't my thang
If I think with my dick then put your mouth on my brains

I maintain through the atmosphere, what we got here
A sucka in fear, hear the roars and the cheers
From the crowd when I take the mile, let me show 'em how
Hit the ball on the ground and make 'em get down

I say the fish don't fry in the kitchen
Beans don't burn on the grill
It took a whole lot of tah-ryin'
Just to get up that hill

I said but now we're up in the Big Leagues
My dirty, it's our turn at bat
And just as long as we livin', it's Lunatics playa
It ain't nuttin' wrong with that, huh, batter up

Well, Bob this next young batter on deck
He's still in high school
(Yeah I heard that, it's a great day though)
A good high school out in U-City of St. Louis, Missouri
(I think his name's umm, who knows
Mur-uhh, Murphey Lee or somethin')

I want my name not, not said but screamed
I went from fantasies to dreams from dreams to bigger things
I'm like Bennett I been in it since, ninety-three
You can tell 'cause my L angle 90 degrees

I'ma sixteen year-old school boy, platinum skills
Swear to tell the real, the whole real to make a mill'
I lie little but still, talk straight up like motto
I could tell you somethin' now, you think twice about it tomorrow

I promise, I gets deeper than file cabinets when rappin'
What what money, money, money, money what's hapenin'
I'm comin up like family members in basements and I stay bent
Make a Milli to play with, buy a building you can pay me

And the 'tic is who we came with
You know how we do
We do, we do, we do, we do, we do

I say the fish don't fry in the kitchen
Beans don't burn on the grill
It took a whole lot of tah-ryin'
Just to get up that hill

I said but now we're up in the Big Leagues
My dirty, it's our turn at bat
And just as long as we livin', it's Lunatics playa
It ain't nuttin' wrong with that, huh, batter up

Oh, my god, Bob, did you see the game?
Bob Bob, what are you doing lookin' at the sky? Bob
It's a great fuckin' day
Oh shit, Bob, are you on drugs?
No no

Bob, Bob, look at me Bob
No, I'm not, no no, shut up, stay on the topic
Oh my god
I do think it was a great game today
(You missed a great game, Bob)

That first guy, I, I, I really liked him
He was, 'knock it out the park' guy
Please us sqeeze us
The second guy, I like him too
He was moving around those bases Swing batter batter, swing batter batter, swing batter up
Swing batter batter, swing batter batter, swing batter up
Swing batter batter, swing batter batter, swing batter up
Swing batter batter, swing batter batter, swing batter up
