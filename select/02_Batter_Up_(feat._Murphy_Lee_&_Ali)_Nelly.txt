Welcome ladies and gentlemen
This is Mark oh, who gives a fuck, from '93 TV
This is my co-host, Bob Buttafuoco
Bob, say hi
(Hey hey guys) Yeah yeah yeah
We ain't got a crowd that's in a frenzy Bob
Let's go down to the announcers
For the start of the game

And now, please rise for the singing
Of our national anthem

I said the fish don't fry in the kitchen
Beans don't burn on the grill
Took a whole lot of tryin'
Just to get up that hill
I said, but now were up in the big leagues (big leagues)
My dirty it's our turn at bat
And just as long as we livin'
It's lunatics player
It ain't nothing wrong with that, ouu oh
We batter up

I'm the first to swing
Home run with that
Give me what you got thing, hot wings
Fuck a dub, smoke an ounce, show me love
Hit the club, me and T-Luv, holla what
I put my mack down, she threw a curve ball
She all nearly smoked that herb
That's some Nelly-bo
She tip-top 'em, Optimo
First base, God livin' like a worst race
First chase, throw yo' people and yo' kind (Alright)
Second lesson
Smoke that herb and clear yo' mind
It's about time, second base wisdom rhyme
Hittin' strong
Skipped third base and headed home
Third baseman just don't understand
Baby with the bong
What the fuck wrong
With this world today?
With these girls today?
Diamonds and pearls the way
You wasn't fuckin' with me, leave
For the wrap that's in my seed
Now you stays on yo' knees
Cause we's be in the big league
Cause we's be in the big leauge

I said the fish don't fry in the kitchen
Beans don't burn on the grill
It took a whole lot of tryin'
Just to get up that hill
I said, but now were up in the big leagues (big leagues)
My dirty it's our turn at bat
And just as long as we livin'
It's lunatics player
It ain't nothing wrong with that, ouu oh
We batter up

Well you should see me now
I'm eatin' wheaties now
I'm stealin' second and third
And lookin' home, gettin' greedy now
See me now, people call me speedy now
Known for runnin' the quickest miles
Hit and run in any town, any ground
Rules 'fore I hit it
Split it, lick it and quit it
And hit it, lick it, did I say lick it (Yeah)
Fuckin' lick it
Ain't no shame in my game
That normal shit ain't my thing
If I speak with my dick
Then switch your mouth on my brains
I maintain through the atmosphere
What we got here?
A sucker in fear
Hear the roars and the cheers
From the crowd when I take the mile
Let me show 'em how
Hit the ball on the ground
And make 'em get down in the dirt

I said the fish don't fry in the kitchen (In the dirt)
Beans don't burn on the grill
It took a whole lot of tryin'
Just to get up that hill
I said, but now were up in the big leagues (big leagues)
My dirty it's our turn at bat
And just as long as we livin'
It's lunatics player
It ain't nothing wrong with that, ouu oh
We batter up

Well Bob this next young batter on deck
He's still in high school (yeah I heard that)
(It's a great day though)
A good high school out in U-City of St. Louis, Missouri
(I think his name's umm, who knows
Mur-uhh, Murphy Lee or something)

I want my name not
Not said but screamed
I went from fantasies to dreams
Dreams to bigger things
I'm like Bennett
I been in it since '93
You can tell cause my L angle 90 degrees
I'ma sixteen year-old school boy
Platinum skills
Swear to tell the real
The whole real to make a mil'
I lie little but still
Talk straight up like motto
I could tell you something now
You think twice about it tomorrow
I promise
I gets deeper than file cabinets when rappin'
What, what
Money, money, money, money was happening
I'm comin' up like family members
In basements and I stay bent
Make a milli to play with
Buy a building you can pay me
And the 'tic is who we came with
You know how we do, we do
We do, we do, we do, we do

I said the fish don't fry in the kitchen
Beans don't burn on the grill
It took a whole lot of tryin'
Just to get up that hill
I said, but now were up in the big leagues (big leagues)
My dirty it our turn at bat
And just as long as we livin'
It's lunatics player
It ain't nothing wrong with that, ouu oh
We batter up

Oh my God, Bob, did you see the game?
Bob, Bob what are you doing lookin at the sky Bob?
Its a great fuckin' day
Oh shit Bob are you on drugs?
Nah, nah I'm not on drugs
Bob, Bob look at me Bob
Shut up let's stay on the topic
Oh my God
I do think it was a great game today
You missed a great game Bob
That that first guy I really liked him
He hit it out of the park
That second guy I liked him too
He was moving around the bases
