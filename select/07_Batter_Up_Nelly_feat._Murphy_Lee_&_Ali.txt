Welcome ladies and gentlemen
This is Mark, oh-Who-gives-a-fuck from '93 TV
This is my co-host, Bob Buttafuoco
(Hey, hey guys) Yeah, yeah, yeah
We got a crowd that's in a frenzy Bob
Let's go down to the announcers for the start of the game
And now, please rise for the singing of our national anthem (mmh)

I say the fish don't fry in the kitchen
Beans don't burn on the grill (that's right)
It took a whole lot of trying
Just to get up that hill
I said, but now we're up in the big leagues
My dirty it's our turn at bat
And just as long as we livin', it's Lunatics playa
It ain't nuttin' wrong with that, huh (batter up)

I'm the first to swing
Home run with that give-me-what-you-got thing, hot wings
Fuck a dub, smoke an ounce, show me love
Hit the club, me and T-Luv holla what (swing, batter-batter, swing, batter-batter, swing, batter up)
I put my mack down, she threw a curve ball
She owed Milli smoked that herb and some Llly-bone
She tip-top 'em, Optimo
First base, God livin', like a worst race (swing, batter-batter, swing, batter-batter, swing, batter up)
First chase, throw yo' people and yo' kind (alright)
Second lesson, smoke that herb and clear yo' mind

It's about time, second base wisdom rhyme
Sittin' strong, skipped third base and headed home (swing, batter-batter, swing, batter-batter, swing)
Third baseman just don't understand, baby, where the bong (batter up)
What the fuck wrong, with this world today?
With these girls today, diamonds and pearls the way
You wasn't fuckin' with me, leave, for the wrap that's in my seed (swing, batter-batter, swing, batter-batter)
Now you stays on yo knees 'cause we's be in the big league (swing, batter up)
'Cause we's be in the big league (mmh)

I say the fish don't fry in the kitchen
Beans don't burn on the grill (that's right)
It took a whole lot of trying
Just to get up that hill
I said but now we're up in the big leagues
My dirty it's our turn at bat
And just as long as we livin', it's Lunatics playa
It ain't nuttin' wrong with that, huh (batter up)

Well you should see me now, I'm eatin' Wheaties now (han-han)
I'm stealin' second and third, lookin' home, gettin' greedy now (han, han, han, hoo)
See me now, people call me speedy now
Known for runnin' the quickest miles (swing, batter-batter)
Hit and run in any town, any ground (swing, batter-batter, swing, batter up)

Rules 'fore I hit it, split it, lick it and quit it
And hit it, lick it, did I say lick it, (yeah) fuck it, lick it
Ain't no shame in my game, that normal shit ain't my thang
If I think with my dick then put your mouth on my brain (swing, batter-batter, swing, batter-batter)
I maintain, through the atmosphere, what we got here (swing, batter up)
A sucker in fear, hear the roars and the cheers
From the crowd when I take the mile, let me show 'em how
Hit the ball on the ground (swing, batter-batter)
And make 'em get down (swing, batter-batter, swing batter up) (mmh)

I say the fish don't fry in the kitchen
Beans don't burn on the grill (that's right)

Well Bob, this next young batter on deck
He's still in high school (yeah, I heard that, it's a great day though)
A good high school out in U-City of Saint Louis, Missouri
(I think his name's umm, who knows)
(Mur-uhh, Murphey Lee or somethin')

I want my name not, not said but screamed
I went from fantasies to dreams, dreams to bigger things
I'm like Bennett I been in it since, ninety-three
You can tell cause my L angle 90 degrees
I'm a 16-year-old school boy, platinum skills
Swear to tell the real, the whole real to make a mill'

I lie little but still, talk straight up like motto
I could tell you somethin' now, you think twice about it tomorrow
I promise, I gets deeper than file cabinets when rappin'
Money, money, money, money what's happenin'
I'm comin' up like family members in basements, and I stay bent
Make a milli' to play with, buy a building you can pay me
And the 'tic is who I came with, you know how we do
We do, we do, we do, we do, we do (mmh)

I say the fish don't fry in the kitchen
Beans don't burn on the grill (that's right)
It took a whole lot of trying
Just to get up that hill
I said, but now we're up in the big leagues
My dirty it's our turn at bat
And just as long as we livin', it's Lunatics playa
It ain't nuttin' wrong with that, huh (batter up)

Oh my God Bob did you see the game?
Bob, Bob what are you doing lookin' at the sky Bob? (It's a great fuckin' day)
Oh shit Bob are you on drugs? (Naw, naw I'm not on drugs) Bob, Bob, look at me Bob
(Shut up let's stay on the topic) Oh my God
(I do think it was a great game today) You missed a great game Bob
(That first guy I really liked him, he hit it out of the park) Please, let's squeeze us
(The second guy I liked him too, he was moving around the bases) Love him

Swing (batter-batter), swing (batter-batter), swing (batter up)
Swing (batter-batter), swing (batter-batter), swing (batter up)
Swing (batter-batter), swing (batter-batter), swing (batter up)
Swing (batter-batter), swing (batter-batter), swing (batter up)
